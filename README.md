# Blackjack (Python)

## What is this?

A simple console implementation of the game Blackjack, written in Python.  It's based on a similar Blackjack program I previously coded in C#, which can be be found [here](https://github.com/vitamins999/Blackjack).

## What the rules?

Check them out [here](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/).

## Anything else to know?

Betting is now supported. You have a starting balance of £100.00 and can bet anything up to your balance. The balance goes up or down depending on whether you win or lose, and when it reaches £0, the game ends.

If you want to keep gambling, load up the program again and your money will be reset. Just like in real life.

Have fun!
